3D printed Lab Equipment for Undergraduate Engineering Courses
This repository contains the cad models, laboratory handout, and instructional videos for the developed 
laboratory equipment. This project is funded by NSF under the award number of 2002350.

The project aims to:
1. Develop mainly 3D printed laboratory equipment (3D-PLE) that are compact, modular, small scale, and bundled with classroom activities designed using a learning sciences approach connecting several critical educational theories.
2. Target budget of $100 including the device and necessary components for data acquisition.
